## Description
Ten questions are presented to you to challenge your Javascript know-how, and you will have 75 seconds to answer them all. Get a question right, and your score will increase! The quicker you answer, the higher your score will be. Get a question wrong, however, and the timer will lose time, and you will not earn more points.

When you click on the answer you think is correct, the application will let you know if you got it right or wrong, before moving onto the next question.

Once you have completed the quiz, you will be able to save your initials and high scores for all to see! (But don't worry, if you find yourself embarrased by your score, you can always erase the highscore history!)
